# Product Catalog Webpage

**Objective**: In this assignment, you will create a product catalog webpage using HTML. You'll structure the page to display a list of products with images and descriptions.

## Instructions

### Set Up Your Environment

1. Create a new directory for this assignment on your local machine.

2. Inside the directory, create two files: `index.html` and `styles.css`.

3. Link the `styles.css` file to your `index.html` file using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` section.

### HTML Structure

4. In the `index.html` file, create the basic structure of an HTML document using the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.

5. Add an `<html>` element with `<head>` and `<body>` sections.

### Head Section

6. Inside the `<head>` section, set a title for your webpage.

7. Link the `styles.css` file to your HTML file using the `<link>` tag.

### Body Section

8. Inside the `<body>` section, create a header with the title "Product Catalog" (`<h1>`).

9. Create a product list using an unordered list (`<ul>`).

10. For each product in the list, create a list item (`<li>`) that contains:
    - An image of the product.
    - A product name (e.g., "Product Name").
    - A product description (e.g., "Description of the product.").

### Styling with CSS

11. In the `styles.css` file, apply the following styles:
    - Set a background color for the body.
    - Style the header background and text color.
    - Style the product list to display items in a grid.
    - Customize the font family, size, and color.

12. Add a hover effect to the product list items, such as changing the background color or adding a border.

### Validation

13. Validate your HTML code using an online HTML validator (e.g., W3C Markup Validation Service) to ensure it's error-free.

### Testing

14. Open your `index.html` file in a web browser to view your product catalog webpage.

## Submission

- Create a ZIP archive of your assignment directory (including `index.html` and `styles.css`) and submit it through the designated method provided by your instructor.

**Note**: You can include as many products as you like in your catalog. Be creative with your product descriptions and styling to make your catalog visually appealing.
